<h2> Introduction </h2>
Aliveline is an Android productivity app that appeals to those who like to calculate the required number of hours he or she must do per day to complete an assignment by a certain deadline. The app currently calculates the number of hours needed to work per day in a linear fashion for those who want to procrastinate, get a head start and work less later, or have a balanced workload everyday. Split into four tabs (home, calendar, timer, and settings), the app allows users to quickly view different tasks (AKA Todos) and keep track of how much time they spent and need to spend to complete an assignment.
